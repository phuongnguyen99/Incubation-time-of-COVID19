# Incubation_time_COVID19
COVID-19 is a global pandemic, which has killed millions of people. The study of incubation time of this disease is very important for us since incubation time is the time from infection to symptom onset. Knowing incubation time can help us limit the risk of infection and set up propre quaratine procedures 
We estimate incubation time by doing regression model with 3 methods: Midpoint imputation, Interval-censored and Multiple imputations
